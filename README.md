# SignCoachHardwareTests
Demonstration code for testing the robot. To be copied/rewritten into SignCoachRPI when completed.

Currently contains basic.py, an ev3 python program that sets a home position with the touch sensor, then cycles through the signs corresponding to different classes of letter.

The socket code is for connection between the raspberry pi and the ev3s.
